This folder contains implementation of some core Meta Learning algorithm. There are three algorithm in this folder trained on the euclidean dataset. Those are:

- Model Agnostic Meta Learning
- Matching Network
- Conditional Neural Processing

Refer to notebooks,
`MAML.ipynb` for MAML
`MAN.ipynb`  for Matching Network
`CNP.ipynb`  for Conditional Neural Processing
